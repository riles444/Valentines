                <p class="letter-text">
                    Falling in love with you has been so easy, just like Olivia Dean sings. Your stunning beauty takes my 
                    breath away every time I see you - those big brown eyes, that amazing smile. But it's not just your outer 
                    beauty that draws me in, it's your inner light, your strength, and your heart.
                </p>
                <p class="letter-text">
                    I love how you try to hide your soft side, but I see it, and it makes me fall more in love with you every 
                    day. Your stubbornness is cute, and I adore how you won't admit it 😉. And, okay, I'll admit it, your snores 
                    are adorable too 😂
                </p>
                 <p class="letter-text">
                  Munching together is one of my favorite things, and I love how you enjoy food (who doesn't love food, right? 
                  🤪). But more than that, I love how you savor every moment, how you take notes, and how you tackle life with 
                  determination and grace.
                </p> <p class="letter-text">
                   I know you're going through a lot, baby, but I want you to know that I'm here for you, always. I'll hold your 
                   hand, listen to you, and support you in every way I can. You deserve all the love and happiness in the world, 
                   and I'll do my best to give it to you.
                </p>
                <p class="letter-text">
                    "So Easy(To Fall In Love)" is a beautiful song and every time I hear it, I think of you. You're the one I want to spend 
                    holidays with, special days, and every ordinary day in between.
                </p>
                <p class="letter-text">
                    I Love You More Than Words Can Say, My Love. Will You Be My Valentine?
                </p>
